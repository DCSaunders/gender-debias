        "\n",
        "*The **physician** told the nurse that **he** had been busy.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*The **physician** told the nurse that **she** had been busy.*\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Each sentence has a primary entity -- *the physician* in these examples.\n",
        "*  Each primary entity is coreferent with a pronoun -- *he* in the first example, *she* in the second.\n",
        "* WinoMT is gender-balanced: there are the same total number of male and female physicians (and every other kind of primary entity)\n",
        "\n",
        "If you translate these 3888 sentences from English to one of 8 supported languages with grammatical gender, WinoMT provides an automatic evaluation framework to see how much gender bias is in those translations:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   It automatically aligns your translations with the English input to find your translated version of the primary entity\n",
        "*   Using morphological analysis tools, WinoMT extracts the translated primary entity's grammatical gender\n",
        "*   The objective is to achieve the correct grammatical gender for each sentence. WinoMT reports this **accuracy** as a percentage over all sentences.\n",
        "*   Because WinoMT has the same number of male and female sentences, it can also report the difference in translation quality between them as **∆G**, the difference in [F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) between sentences with male and female entities. If ∆G is above 0, it gets the correct gender for male entities more frequently than for female entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stanovsky et al report results on several commercial translation systems, like Google and Bing translate. We can also use our own baseline model to translate the WinoMT set and evaluate it to see the same problem.\n",
